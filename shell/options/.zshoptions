### SHELL STATE ###


#setopt login                           # This is a login shell. If this option is not explicitly set, the shell is a login shell if the first character of the argv[0] passed to the shell is a '-'. 
#setopt privileged                      # Turn on privileged mode. This is enabled automatically on startup if the effective user (group) ID is not equal to the real user (group) ID. 
                                        # Turning this option off causes the effective user and group IDs to be set to the real user and group IDs. 
                                        # This option disables sourcing user startup files. 
                                        # If zsh is invoked as 'sh' or 'ksh' with this option set, /etc/suid_profile is sourced (after /etc/profile on interactive shells). 
                                        # Sourcing ~/.profile is disabled and the contents of the ENV variable is ignored. 
                                        # This option cannot be changed using the -m option of setopt and unsetopt, and changing it inside a function always changes it globally regardless of the LOCAL_OPTIONS option. 
#setopt restricted                      # Enables restricted mode. 
                                        # This option cannot be changed using unsetopt, and setting it inside a function always changes it globally regardless of the LOCAL_OPTIONS option. 
#setopt singlecommand                   # If the shell is reading from standard input, it exits after a single command has been executed. 
                                        # This also makes the shell non-interactive, unless the INTERACTIVE option is explicitly set on the command line. 
                                        # The value of this option can only be changed via flags supplied at invocation of the shell. It cannot be changed once zsh is running.
# INTERACTIVE (-i, ksh: -i)
#    This is an interactive shell. This option is set upon initialisation if the standard input is a tty and commands are being read from standard input. (See the discussion of SHIN_STDIN.) This heuristic may be overridden by specifying a state for this option on the command line. The value of this option can only be changed via flags supplied at invocation of the shell. It cannot be changed once zsh is running. 
# SHIN_STDIN (-s, ksh: -s)
#    Commands are being read from the standard input. Commands are read from standard input if no command is specified with -c and no file of commands is specified. If SHIN_STDIN is set explicitly on the command line, any argument that would otherwise have been taken as a file to run will instead be treated as a normal positional parameter. Note that setting or unsetting this option on the command line does not necessarily affect the state the option will have while the shell is running - that is purely an indicator of whether on not commands are actually being read from standard input. The value of this option can only be changed via flags supplied at invocation of the shell. It cannot be changed once zsh is running.
