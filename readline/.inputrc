#If you copy commands from the web, you might have noticed that when you copy a newline, Bash will interpret that newline as an Enter and execute whatever it is in your input buffer at the moment. This is unsafe, because what you see might not be what you copy. You can be avoided by setting:
set enable-bracketed-paste On

 # Make sure we don't output everything on the 1 line
set horizontal-scroll-mode Off

# Enable 8bit input
set meta-flag On 
set input-meta On

# Turns off 8th bit stripping
set convert-meta Off

# Keep the 8th bit for display
set output-meta On

# none, visible or audible
set bell-style none

# This line sets every completion which is a symbolic link to a directory to have a slash appended.
#set mark-symlinked-directories On

# No echoing of f.ex. ^C after pressing keys
set echo-control-characters off

set revert-all-at-newline on

#This line sets 3 to be the maximum number of characters to be the common prefix to display for completions. 
#If the common prefix has more than 3 characters, they are replaced by ellipsis. For example, assume we are in a directory with files Screenshot_20170730.png and Screenshot_20170731.png. 
#If using the default option, an auto completion prints Screenshot_20170730.png Screenshot_20170731.png. If this option is set, then the auto completion prints ...0.png ...1.png. However, if the common prefix is very short (fewer or equal to 3 characters), the full file names are still printed. 
#For example, in a directory with files S10.png and S11.png, an auto completion still prints S10.png S11.png. 
#This can be very useful when auto completing in a directory in which a lot of files have a long common prefix, such a camera image directory.
#set completion-prefix-display-length 3

# Prevent the prompt 'Display all possibilities? (y/n)'
set completion-query-items 0

# This line sets readline to display possible completions using different colors to indicate their file types. The colors are determined by the environmental variable LS_COLORS, which can be nicely configured.
