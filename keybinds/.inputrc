#If you copy commands from the web, you might have noticed that when you copy a newline, Bash will interpret that newline as an Enter and execute whatever it is in your input buffer at the moment. This is unsafe, because what you see might not be what you copy. You can be avoided by setting:

#This line sets 3 to be the maximum number of characters to be the common prefix to display for completions. 
#If the common prefix has more than 3 characters, they are replaced by ellipsis. For example, assume we are in a directory with files Screenshot_20170730.png and Screenshot_20170731.png. 
#If using the default option, an auto completion prints Screenshot_20170730.png Screenshot_20170731.png. If this option is set, then the auto completion prints ...0.png ...1.png. However, if the common prefix is very short (fewer or equal to 3 characters), the full file names are still printed. 
#For example, in a directory with files S10.png and S11.png, an auto completion still prints S10.png S11.png. 
#This can be very useful when auto completing in a directory in which a lot of files have a long common prefix, such a camera image directory.
